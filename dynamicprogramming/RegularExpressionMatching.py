Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.

'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Note:

s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.

If there were no Kleene stars (the * wildcard character for regular expressions), the problem would be easier - we simply check from left to right if each character of the text matches the pattern.

When a star is present, we may need to check many different suffixes of the text and see if they match the rest of the pattern. A recursive solution is a straightforward way to represent this relationship.
